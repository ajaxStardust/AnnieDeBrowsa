Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office (Consumer Protection Division): This seems the most appropriate starting point, as Company A's actions might be considered unfair or deceptive business practices. The AG's office can investigate and take action if necessary.
Pennsylvania Department of State (Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs): If Company A is engaged in unethical practices related to LLM training, this bureau might be able to assist in addressing licensing or regulatory issues.
Centre County Consumer Protection Agency: While this agency might not have direct jurisdiction over LLM training, they can offer guidance and support, potentially connecting you with more specialized resources.
Pennsylvania State Police: If you believe Company A's actions constitute a criminal offense, such as fraud or theft, contacting the state police is an option. However, this might be a more serious and formal step, so it's best to explore other avenues first.
Local Law Enforcement (State College Police Department): While local law enforcement can offer guidance, they might not have the specific expertise or jurisdiction to address these issues. It's best to start with more specialized agencies and resources.


Agency A is training LLM for Agency B 

Evidence suggests  Agency B   might be Anthropic, developer of Claude  (amongst the top 5 AI developers on the planet)    Agency A is not following the parameters provided by Agency B

According to the guidelines of the "Task" set forth by Agency A to its contracted employees, of which I am one, formerly. 

The parameters of the Task require a fair amount of thought and preparation. Agency A had limited tasking agents to 100 submissions per day. In my circumstance, it took the AI approximately 20 minutes to reply. Do the math: there are 1440 minutes in a day, if no one sleeps. 

Agency A witnessed much lower production numbers than expected. The 100 submission per day limit was lifted. Some agents were reporting having submitted over 400 tasks per day. 
Agency A pays $1 per task submitted, and additional .40 per each of optional multiple items for processing. 

Agency A is encouraging contracted employees to submit as many as possible, regardless the quality of the data and ethical consequences.
