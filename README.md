# Annie DeBrowsa (ADB) - Any Dir Browser

[![Status](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=ajaxStardust&repo=AnnieDeBrowsa&show_owner=true)](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app)

## Description
This project was started in the late 2000s out of my desire to have a means of previewing old website projects stored on a development server. Consider it a "static content management system" â€” not a file manager.

## Installation
Clone it into your HTTP server document root, or any directory where you want to preview your files without leaving your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajaxStardust/AnnieDeBrowsa.git
```

If you prefer using a single command for quick installation, you can run: 

```
curl -o- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ajaxStardust/674b5d86f1f4386e72937a607e263608/raw/install.sh > ~/install_adb_by_ajaxStardust.sh
chmod 755 ~/install_adb_by_ajaxStardust.sh
nano ~/install_adb_by_ajaxStardust.sh
```
This will automatically set up the project and make it ready for you to use, as shown:

**NOTE:** You must edit approx line 40 to set correct paths for variables used. Otherewise, you may discover it has created this "one-one-zero-one...one-one-zero-one!"

> _Check lines 37-40 of the install.sh shell script._
... or is it the _transform.sh_ script? Hmm... 

## Usage

To use Annie DeBrowsa, simply run the following command:
```
bash transform.sh <directory_name>
```

> The idea is actually to copy the .sh script to /usr/local/bin/transform.sh

e.g. in .bashrc  add a line like 
```alias 2url=/usr/local/bin/transform.sh ```

so you can just type 
2url ./index.html 
to get 
https://localhost/adb-logic-to-transform-something-whatever/


this will print the URL that you can use to view your files in a browser.

**Note** If you want to open the URL automatically in your browser, you can uncomment the `xdg-open` line in the `transform.sh` script.

For more details, refer to the [transform.sh script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaxStardust/AnnieDeBrowsa/refs/heads/master/i_am_become_url.sh).
