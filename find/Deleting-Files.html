<h3 class="section" id="Deleting-Files-1">10.1 Deleting Files</h3>

<p>One of the most common tasks that <code class="code">find</code> is used for is locating
files that can be deleted.  This might include:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Files last modified more than 3 years ago which haven&rsquo;t been accessed
for at least 2 years
</li><li>Files belonging to a certain user
</li><li>Temporary files which are no longer required
</li></ul>

<p>This example concentrates on the actual deletion task rather than on
sophisticated ways of locating the files that need to be deleted.
We&rsquo;ll assume that the files we want to delete are old files underneath
<samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff</samp>.

<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="The-Traditional-Way">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.1 The Traditional Way</h4>

<p>The traditional way to delete files in <samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff</samp> that have
not been modified in over 90 days would have been:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -exec /bin/rm {} \;
</pre></div>

<p>The above command uses &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; to run the <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> command
to remove each file.  This approach works and in fact would have
worked in Version 7 Unix in 1979.  However, there are a number of
problems with this approach.
</p>

<p>The most obvious problem with the approach above is that it causes
<code class="code">find</code> to fork every time it finds a file that needs to delete,
and the child process then has to use the <code class="code">exec</code> system call to
launch <code class="code">/bin/rm</code>.   All this is quite inefficient.  If we are
going to use <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> to do this job, it is better to make it
delete more than one file at a time.
</p>
<p>The most obvious way of doing this is to use the shell&rsquo;s command
expansion feature:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/bin/rm `find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -print`
</pre></div>
<p>or you could use the more modern form
</p><div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/bin/rm $(find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -print)
</pre></div>

<p>The commands above are much more efficient than the first attempt.
However, there is a problem with them.  The shell has a maximum
command length which is imposed by the operating system (the actual
limit varies between systems).  This means that while the command
expansion technique will usually work, it will suddenly fail when
there are lots of files to delete.  Since the task is to delete
unwanted files, this is precisely the time we don&rsquo;t want things to go
wrong.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Making-Use-of-xargs">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.2 Making Use of <code class="code">xargs</code></h4>

<p>So, is there a way to be more efficient in the use of <code class="code">fork()</code>
and <code class="code">exec()</code> without running up against this limit?
Yes, we can be almost optimally efficient by making use
of the <code class="code">xargs</code> command.  The <code class="code">xargs</code> command reads arguments
from its standard input and builds them into command lines.  We can
use it like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -print | xargs /bin/rm
</pre></div>

<p>For example if the files found by <code class="code">find</code> are
<samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff/A</samp>,
<samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff/B</samp> and
<samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff/C</samp> then <code class="code">xargs</code> might issue the commands
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/bin/rm /var/tmp/stuff/A /var/tmp/stuff/B
/bin/rm /var/tmp/stuff/C
</pre></div>

<p>The above assumes that <code class="code">xargs</code> has a very small maximum command
line length.  The real limit is much larger but the idea is that
<code class="code">xargs</code> will run <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> as many times as necessary to get
the job done, given the limits on command line length.
</p>
<p>This usage of <code class="code">xargs</code> is pretty efficient, and the <code class="code">xargs</code>
command is widely implemented (all modern versions of Unix offer it).
So far then, the news is all good.  However, there is bad news too.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Unusual-characters-in-filenames">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.3 Unusual characters in filenames</h4>

<p>Unix-like systems allow any characters to appear in file names with
the exception of the ASCII NUL character and the slash.
Slashes can occur in path names (as the directory separator) but
not in the names of actual directory entries.  This means that the
list of files that <code class="code">xargs</code> reads could in fact contain white space
characters &ndash; spaces, tabs and newline characters.  Since by default,
<code class="code">xargs</code> assumes that the list of files it is reading uses white
space as an argument separator, it cannot correctly handle the case
where a filename actually includes white space.  This makes the
default behaviour of <code class="code">xargs</code> almost useless for handling
arbitrary data.
</p>
<p>To solve this problem, GNU findutils introduced the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-print0</samp>&rsquo;
action for <code class="code">find</code>.  This uses the ASCII NUL character to separate
the entries in the file list that it produces.  This is the ideal
choice of separator since it is the only character that cannot appear
within a path name.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-0</samp>&rsquo; option to <code class="code">xargs</code> makes it
assume that arguments are separated with ASCII NUL instead of white
space.  It also turns off another misfeature in the default behaviour
of <code class="code">xargs</code>, which is that it pays attention to quote characters
in its input.  Some versions of <code class="code">xargs</code> also terminate when they
see a lone &lsquo;<samp class="samp">_</samp>&rsquo; in the input, but GNU <code class="code">find</code> no longer does
that (since it has become an optional behaviour in the Unix standard).
</p>
<p>So, putting <code class="code">find -print0</code> together with <code class="code">xargs -0</code> we get
this command:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm
</pre></div>

<p>The result is an efficient way of proceeding that
correctly handles all the possible characters that could appear in the
list of files to delete.  This is good news.  However, there is, as
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re expecting, also more bad news.  The problem is that
this is not a portable construct; although other versions of Unix
(notably BSD-derived ones) support &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-print0</samp>&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s not
universal.  So, is there a more universal mechanism?
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Going-back-to-_002dexec">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.4 Going back to <code class="code">-exec</code></h4>

<p>There is indeed a more universal mechanism, which is a slight
modification to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; action.  The normal &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo;
action assumes that the command to run is terminated with a semicolon
(the semicolon normally has to be quoted in order to protect it from
interpretation as the shell command separator).  The SVR4 edition of
Unix introduced a slight variation, which involves terminating the
command with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo; instead:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -exec /bin/rm {} \+
</pre></div>

<p>The above use of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; causes <code class="code">find</code> to build up a long
command line and then issue it.  This can be less efficient than some
uses of <code class="code">xargs</code>; for example <code class="code">xargs</code> allows building up
new command lines while the previous command is still executing, and
allows specifying a number of commands to run in parallel.
However, the <code class="code">find &hellip; -exec &hellip; +</code> construct has the advantage
of wide portability.  GNU findutils did not support &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec &hellip; +</samp>&rsquo;
until version 4.2.12; one of the reasons for this is that it already
had the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-print0</samp>&rsquo; action in any case.
</p>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="A-more-secure-version-of-_002dexec">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.5 A more secure version of <code class="code">-exec</code></h4>

<p>The command above seems to be efficient and portable.  However,
within it lurks a security problem.  The problem is shared with
all the commands we&rsquo;ve tried in this worked example so far, too.  The
security problem is a race condition; that is, if it is possible for
somebody to manipulate the filesystem that you are searching while you
are searching it, it is possible for them to persuade your <code class="code">find</code>
command to cause the deletion of a file that you can delete but they
normally cannot.
</p>
<p>The problem occurs because the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; action is defined by the
POSIX standard to invoke its command with the same working directory
as <code class="code">find</code> had when it was started.  This means that the arguments
which replace the {} include a relative path from <code class="code">find</code>&rsquo;s
starting point down the file that needs to be deleted.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -exec /bin/rm {} \+
</pre></div>

<p>might actually issue the command:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/bin/rm /var/tmp/stuff/A /var/tmp/stuff/B /var/tmp/stuff/passwd
</pre></div>

<p>Notice the file <samp class="file">/var/tmp/stuff/passwd</samp>.  Likewise, the command:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">cd /var/tmp &amp;&amp; find stuff -mtime +90 -exec /bin/rm {} \+
</pre></div>

<p>might actually issue the command:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/bin/rm stuff/A stuff/B stuff/passwd
</pre></div>

<p>If an attacker can rename <samp class="file">stuff</samp> to something else (making use
of their write permissions in <samp class="file">/var/tmp</samp>) they can replace it
with a symbolic link to <samp class="file">/etc</samp>.  That means that the
<code class="code">/bin/rm</code> command will be invoked on <samp class="file">/etc/passwd</samp>.  If you
are running your <code class="code">find</code> command as root, the attacker has just managed
to delete a vital file.  All they needed to do to achieve this was
replace a subdirectory with a symbolic link at the vital moment.
</p>
<p>There is however, a simple solution to the problem.  This is an action
which works a lot like <code class="code">-exec</code> but doesn&rsquo;t need to traverse a
chain of directories to reach the file that it needs to work on.  This
is the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; action, which was introduced by the BSD family
of operating systems.   The command,
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -execdir /bin/rm {} \+
</pre></div>

<p>might delete a set of files by performing these actions:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Change directory to /var/tmp/stuff/foo
</li><li> Invoke <code class="code">/bin/rm ./file1 ./file2 ./file3</code>
</li><li> Change directory to /var/tmp/stuff/bar
</li><li> Invoke <code class="code">/bin/rm ./file99 ./file100 ./file101</code>
</li></ol>

<p>This is a much more secure method.  We are no longer exposed to a race
condition.  For many typical uses of <code class="code">find</code>, this is the best
strategy.   It&rsquo;s reasonably efficient, but the length of the command
line is limited not just by the operating system limits, but also by
how many files we actually need to delete from each directory.
</p>
<p>Is it possible to do any better?   In the case of general file
processing, no.  However, in the specific case of deleting files it is
indeed possible to do better.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Using-the-_002ddelete-action">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.6 Using the <code class="code">-delete</code> action</h4>

<p>The most efficient and secure method of solving this problem is to use
the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-delete</samp>&rsquo; action:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff -mtime +90 -delete
</pre></div>

<p>This alternative is more efficient than any of the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; actions, since it entirely avoids the overhead of
forking a new process and using <code class="code">exec</code> to run <code class="code">/bin/rm</code>.  It
is also normally more efficient than <code class="code">xargs</code> for the same
reason.   The file deletion is performed from the directory containing
the entry to be deleted, so the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-delete</samp>&rsquo; action has the same
security advantages as the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; action has.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-delete</samp>&rsquo; action was introduced by the BSD family of
operating systems.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Improving-things-still-further">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.7 Improving things still further</h4>

<p>Is it possible to improve things still further?  Not without either
modifying the system library to the operating system or having more specific
knowledge of the layout of the filesystem and disk I/O subsystem, or
both.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">find</code> command traverses the filesystem, reading
directories.  It then issues a separate system call for each file to
be deleted.  If we could modify the operating system, there are
potential gains that could be made:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>We could have a system call to which we pass more than one filename
for deletion
</li><li>Alternatively, we could pass in a list of inode numbers (on GNU/Linux
systems, <code class="code">readdir()</code> also returns the inode number of each
directory entry) to be deleted.
</li></ul>

<p>The above possibilities sound interesting, but from the kernel&rsquo;s point
of view it is difficult to enforce standard Unix access controls for
such processing by inode number.  Such a facility would probably
need to be restricted to the superuser.
</p>
<p>Another way of improving performance would be to increase the
parallelism of the process.  For example if the directory hierarchy we
are searching is actually spread across a number of disks, we might
somehow be able to arrange for <code class="code">find</code> to process each disk in
parallel.  In practice GNU <code class="code">find</code> doesn&rsquo;t have such an intimate
understanding of the system&rsquo;s filesystem layout and disk I/O
subsystem.
</p>
<p>However, since the system administrator can have such an understanding
they can take advantage of it like so:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /var/tmp/stuff1 -mtime +90 -delete &amp;
find /var/tmp/stuff2 -mtime +90 -delete &amp;
find /var/tmp/stuff3 -mtime +90 -delete &amp;
find /var/tmp/stuff4 -mtime +90 -delete &amp;
wait
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, four separate instances of <code class="code">find</code> are used
to search four subdirectories in parallel.  The <code class="code">wait</code> command
simply waits for all of these to complete.  Whether this approach is
more or less efficient than a single instance of <code class="code">find</code> depends
on a number of things:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Are the directories being searched in parallel actually on separate
disks?  If not, this parallel search might just result in a lot of
disk head movement and so the speed might even be slower.
</li><li>Other activity - are other programs also doing things on those disks?
</li></ul>


</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Conclusion">
<h4 class="subsection">10.1.8 Conclusion</h4>

<p>The fastest and most secure way to delete files with the help of
<code class="code">find</code> is to use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-delete</samp>&rsquo;.  Using <code class="code">xargs -0 -P N</code> can
also make effective use of the disk, but it is not as secure.
</p>
<p>In the case where we&rsquo;re doing things other than deleting files, the
most secure alternative is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir &hellip; +</samp>&rsquo;, but this is not as
portable as the insecure action &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec &hellip; +</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-delete</samp>&rsquo; action is not completely portable, but the only
other possibility which is as secure (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo;) is no more
portable.  The most efficient portable alternative is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec
&hellip;+</samp>&rsquo;, but this is insecure and isn&rsquo;t supported by versions of GNU
findutils prior to 4.2.12.
