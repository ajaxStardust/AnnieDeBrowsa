<h4 class="subsection" id="Race-Conditions-with-_002dexec-1">11.2.3 Race Conditions with <code class="code">-exec</code></h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; action causes another program to be run.  It passes
to the program the name of the file which is being considered at the
time.  The invoked program will typically then perform some action
on that file.  Once again, there is a race condition which can be
exploited here.  We shall take as a specific example the command
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find /tmp -path /tmp/umsp/passwd -exec /bin/rm
</pre></div>

<p>In this simple example, we are identifying just one file to be deleted
and invoking <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> to delete it.  A problem exists because
there is a time gap between the point where <code class="code">find</code> decides that
it needs to process the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; action and the point where the
<code class="code">/bin/rm</code> command actually issues the <code class="code">unlink()</code> system
call to delete the file from the filesystem.  Within this time period, an attacker can rename the
<samp class="file">/tmp/umsp</samp> directory, replacing it with a symbolic link to
<samp class="file">/etc</samp>.  There is no way for <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> to determine that it
is working on the same file that <code class="code">find</code> had in mind.  Once the
symbolic link is in place, the attacker has persuaded <code class="code">find</code> to
cause the deletion of the <samp class="file">/etc/passwd</samp> file, which is not the
effect intended by the command which was actually invoked.
</p>
<p>One possible defence against this type of attack is to modify the
behaviour of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; so that the <code class="code">/bin/rm</code> command is run
with the argument <samp class="file">./passwd</samp> and a suitable choice of working
directory.  This would allow the normal sanity check that <code class="code">find</code>
performs to protect against this form of attack too.  Unfortunately,
this strategy cannot be used as the POSIX standard specifies that the
current working directory for commands invoked with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; must
be the same as the current working directory from which <code class="code">find</code>
was invoked.  This means that the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; action is inherently
insecure and can&rsquo;t be fixed.
</p>
<p>GNU <code class="code">find</code> implements a more secure variant of the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo;
action, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; action
ensures that it is not necessary to dereference subdirectories to
process target files.  The current directory used to invoke programs
is the same as the directory in which the file to be processed exists
(<samp class="file">/tmp/umsp</samp> in our example, and only the basename of the file to
be processed is passed to the invoked command, with a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">./</samp>&rsquo;
prepended (giving <samp class="file">./passwd</samp> in our example).
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; action refuses to do anything if the current
directory is included in the <code class="env">PATH</code> environment variable.  This
is necessary because &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; runs programs in the same
directory in which it finds files &ndash; in general, such a directory
might be writable by untrusted users.  For similar reasons,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-execdir</samp>&rsquo; does not allow &lsquo;<samp class="samp">{}</samp>&rsquo; to appear in the name of
the command to be run.
