<p>The <code class="code">xargs</code> and <code class="code">find</code> programs have separate origins but
are collected together in Findutils because they are often used
together.  While today they also share a small amount of
implementation, this wasn&rsquo;t originally the case.  The <code class="code">locate</code>
program started out as a feature of <code class="code">find</code> but today it is a
separate program.

<h3 class="section">13.1 History of <code class="code">find</code></h3>

<p>A <code class="code">find</code> program appeared in Version 5 Unix as part of the
Programmer&rsquo;s Workbench project and was written by Dick Haight.  Doug
McIlroy&rsquo;s <cite class="cite">A Research UNIX Reader: Annotated Excerpts from the
Programmer’s Manual, 1971-1986</cite> provides some additional details; you
can read it on-line at
<a class="url" href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf">https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>GNU <code class="code">find</code> was originally written by Eric Decker, with
enhancements by David MacKenzie, Jay Plett, and Tim Wood.  The idea
for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">find -print0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">xargs -0</samp>&rsquo; came from Dan Bernstein.

<h3 class="section">13.2 History of <code class="code">xargs</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="code">xargs</code> program was invented by Herb Gellis at Bell Labs.  In
his own words:
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>Hi James, Thanks for reaching out. Yes I invented <code class="code">xargs</code> way
back before we even released UNIX to the general public when it was
running on PDP-11 machines with little memory, and capable shell
programs were not there yet - kind of like early IBM PC-DOS command
lines. The name came about, first, by noticing at the time there were
no commands beginning with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x</samp>&rsquo; (silly reason, I know), and then
came up with, basically, &quot;eXecute command with ARGumentS&quot;. This
obviously allowed one to process files, sequentially, including
batches of files, while the UNIX command line buffer was very tiny. I
don&rsquo;t remember exactly how small but possibly only 512 bytes. The very
first use intended was to allow compiling C programs that were broken
into many small routines whose total name length would exceed the
command line buffer. Hope this settles the matter! Oh, another arcane
factoid about <code class="code">xargs</code> at the beginning was that I was able to
keep it smaller than 4k (I think that was the amount) which at the
time was the maximum size of a file segment on PDP-11/UNIX, so that
the program could be loaded completely on the first segment, without
having to go back and get chains of further segments - Hence fast!
</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2023, GNU <code class="code">xargs</code> is unfortunately much larger, around 75KiB
when stripped.
</p>
<p>GNU <code class="code">xargs</code> isn&rsquo;t derived from the original Bell Labs program.
It was originally written by Mike Rendell, with enhancements by David
MacKenzie.

<h3 class="section">13.3 History of <code class="code">locate</code></h3>

<p>4.3-BSD introduced the <em class="dfn">fast-find</em> feature, in which the command
<code class="code">find needle</code> would look for a file named &lsquo;<samp class="samp">needle</samp>&rsquo;.  This
took advantage of the fact that, at the time, there was no valid
two-argument <code class="code">find</code> invocation.  The implementation was much
faster than searching the whole file system in real time, because it
used a pre-built file name database.  This functionality is described
in more detail in <cite class="cite">Finding Files Fast</cite> by James Woods (Usenix
;login, Volume 8 Issue 1, pages. 8-10, 1983).
</p>
<p>Standardisation of <code class="code">find</code> led to this functionality being moved
into the <code class="code">locate</code> program in 4.4-BSD.   The command <code class="code">find
needle</code> now unambiguously means &ldquo;start searching at the file
<code class="code">needle</code> and print the names of the files you encounter&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>GNU <code class="code">locate</code> and its associated utilities were originally written
by James Woods, with enhancements by David MacKenzie.
