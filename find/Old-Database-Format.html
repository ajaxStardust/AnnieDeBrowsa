<h4 class="subsection" id="Old-Database-Format-1">4.2.4 Old Database Format</h4>

<p>The old database format is used by Unix <code class="code">locate</code> and <code class="code">find</code>
programs and pre-4.0 releases of GNU findutils.  <code class="code">locate</code>
understands this format, though <code class="code">updatedb</code> will no longer produce
it.
</p>
<p>The old format differs from &lsquo;<samp class="samp">LOCATE02</samp>&rsquo; in the following ways.
Instead of each entry starting with an offset-differential count byte
and ending with a null, byte values from 0 through 28 indicate
offset-differential counts from -14 through 14.  The byte value
indicating that a long offset-differential count follows is 0x1e (30),
not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host byte order, which is not
necessarily network byte order, and host integer word size, which is
usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14 less than their
value.  The database lines have no termination byte; the start of the
next line is indicated by its first byte having a value &lt;= 30.
</p>
<p>In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database
format starts with a 256 byte table containing the 128 most common
bigrams in the file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.
Bytes in the database that have the high bit set are indexes (with the
high bit cleared) into the bigram table.  The bigram and
offset-differential count coding makes these databases 20-25% smaller
than the new format, but makes them not 8-bit clean.  Any byte in a
file name that is in the ranges used for the special codes is replaced
in the database by a question mark, which not coincidentally is the
shell wildcard to match a single character. The old format therefore
cannot faithfully store entries with non-ASCII characters.
</p>
<p>Because the long counts are stored as
native-order machine words, the database format is not easily used in
environments which differ in terms of byte order.  If locate databases
are to be shared between machines, the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">LOCATE02</samp>&rsquo; database format should
be used.  This has other benefits as discussed above.  However, the
length of the filename currently being processed can normally be used
to place reasonable limits on the long counts and so this information
is used by locate to help it guess the byte ordering of the old format
database.  Unless it finds evidence to the contrary, <code class="code">locate</code>
will assume that the byte order of the database is the same as the
native byte order of the machine running <code class="code">locate</code>.  The output of
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">locate --statistics</samp>&rsquo; also includes information about the byte
order of old-format databases.
</p>
<p>The output of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">locate --statistics</samp>&rsquo; will give an incorrect count
of the number of file names containing newlines or high-bit characters
for old-format databases.
</p>
<p>Old versions of GNU <code class="code">locate</code> fail to correctly handle very long
file names, possibly leading to security problems relating to a heap
buffer overrun.  See <a class="xref" href="Security-Considerations-for-locate.html">Security Considerations for <code class="code">locate</code></a>, for a
detailed explanation.
