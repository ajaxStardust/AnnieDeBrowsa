<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Controlling-Parallelism-1">3.3.2.5 Controlling Parallelism</h4>

<p>Normally, <code class="code">xargs</code> runs one command at a time.  This is called
&quot;serial&quot; execution; the commands happen in a series, one after another.
If you&rsquo;d like <code class="code">xargs</code> to do things in &quot;parallel&quot;, you can ask it
to do so, either when you invoke it, or later while it is running.
Running several commands at one time can make the entire operation
go more quickly, if the commands are independent, and if your system
has enough resources to handle the load.  When parallelism works in
your application, <code class="code">xargs</code> provides an easy way to get your work
done faster.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">--max-procs=<var class="var">max-procs</var></code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">-P <var class="var">max-procs</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Run up to <var class="var">max-procs</var> processes at a time; the default is 1.  If
<var class="var">max-procs</var> is 0, <code class="code">xargs</code> will run as many processes as
possible at a time.  Use the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-n</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-s</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-L</samp>&rsquo; option
with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-P</samp>&rsquo;; otherwise chances are that the command will be run
only once. If a child process exits with status 255, <code class="code">xargs</code> will
still wait for all child processes to exit (before version 4.9.0 this
might not happen).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If <code class="code">xargs</code> is run without the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-P</samp>&rsquo; option, it will not
change the handling of the <code class="code">SIGUSR1</code> and <code class="code">SIGUSR2</code> signals.
This means they will terminate the <code class="code">xargs</code> program unless those
signals were set to be ignored in the parent process of <code class="code">xargs</code>.
If you do not want parallel execution but you also do not want these
signals to be fatal, you can specify <code class="code">-P 1</code>.
</p>
<p>Suppose you have a directory tree of large image files and a
<code class="code">makeallsizes</code> script that takes a single file name and creates
various sized images from it (thumbnail-sized, web-page-sized,
printer-sized, and the original large file).  The script is doing
enough work that it takes significant time to run, even on a single
image.  You could run:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find originals -name '*.jpg' | xargs -L 1 makeallsizes
</pre></div>

<p>This will run <code class="code">makeallsizes <var class="var">filename</var></code> once for each <code class="code">.jpg</code>
file in the <code class="code">originals</code> directory.  However, if your system has
two central processors, this script will only keep one of them busy.
Instead, you could probably finish in about half the time by running:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find originals -name '*.jpg' | xargs -L 1 -P 2 makeallsizes
</pre></div>

<p><code class="code">xargs</code> will run the first two commands in parallel, and then
whenever one of them terminates, it will start another one, until
the entire job is done.
</p>
<p>The same idea can be generalized to as many processors as you have handy.
It also generalizes to other resources besides processors.  For example,
if <code class="code">xargs</code> is running commands that are waiting for a response from a
distant network connection, running a few in parallel may reduce the
overall latency by overlapping their waiting time.
</p>
<p>If you are running commands in parallel, you need to think about how
they should arbitrate access to any resources that they share.  For
example, if more than one of them tries to print to stdout, the output
will be produced in an indeterminate order (and very likely mixed up)
unless the processes collaborate in some way to prevent this.  Using
some kind of locking scheme is one way to prevent such problems.  In
general, using a locking scheme will help ensure correct output but
reduce performance.  If you don&rsquo;t want to tolerate the performance
difference, simply arrange for each process to produce a separate output
file (or otherwise use separate resources).
</p>
<p><code class="code">xargs</code> also allows &ldquo;turning up&rdquo; or &ldquo;turning down&rdquo; its parallelism
in the middle of a run.  Suppose you are keeping your four-processor
system busy for hours, processing thousands of images using <code class="code">-P 4</code>.
Now, in the middle of the run, you or someone else wants you to reduce
your load on the system, so that something else will run faster.
If you interrupt <code class="code">xargs</code>, your job will be half-done, and it
may take significant manual work to resume it only for the remaining
images.  If you suspend <code class="code">xargs</code> using your shell&rsquo;s job controls
(e.g. <code class="code">control-Z</code>), then it will get no work done while suspended.
</p>
<p>Find out the process ID of the <code class="code">xargs</code> process, either from your
shell or with the <code class="code">ps</code> command.  After you send it the signal
<code class="code">SIGUSR2</code>, <code class="code">xargs</code> will run one fewer command in parallel.
If you send it the signal <code class="code">SIGUSR1</code>, it will run one more command
in parallel.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">shell$ xargs &lt;allimages -L 1 -P 4 makeallsizes &amp;
[4] 27643
   ... at some later point ...
shell$ kill -USR2 27643
shell$ kill -USR2 %4
</pre></div>

<p>The first <code class="code">kill</code> command will cause <code class="code">xargs</code> to wait for
two commands to terminate before starting the next command (reducing
the parallelism from 4 to 3).  The second <code class="code">kill</code> will reduce it from
3 to 2.  (<code class="code">%4</code> works in some shells as a shorthand for the process
ID of the background job labeled <code class="code">[4]</code>.)
</p>
<p>Similarly, if you started a long <code class="code">xargs</code> job without parallelism, you
can easily switch it to start running two commands in parallel by sending
it a <code class="code">SIGUSR1</code>.
</p>
<p><code class="code">xargs</code> will never terminate any existing commands when you ask it
to run fewer processes.  It merely waits for the excess commands to
finish.  If you ask it to run more commands, it will start the next
one immediately (if it has more work to do).  If the degree of
parallelism is already 1, sending <code class="code">SIGUSR2</code> will have no further
effect (since <code class="code">--max-procs=0</code> means that there should be no limit
on the number of processes to run).
</p>
<p>There is an implementation-defined limit on the number of processes.
This limit is shown with <code class="code">xargs --show-limits</code>.  The limit is at
least 127 on all systems (and on the author&rsquo;s system it is
2147483647).
</p>
<p>If you send several identical signals quickly, the operating system
does not guarantee that each of them will be delivered to <code class="code">xargs</code>.
This means that you can&rsquo;t rapidly increase or decrease the parallelism by
more than one command at a time.  You can avoid this problem by sending
a signal, observing the result, then sending the next one; or merely by
delaying for a few seconds between signals (unless your system is very
heavily loaded).
</p>
<p>Whether or not parallel execution will work well for you depends on
the nature of the commmand you are running in parallel, on the
configuration of the system on which you are running the command, and
on the other work being done on the system at the time.
