<h3 class="section" id="Updating-A-Timestamp-File-1">10.3 Updating A Timestamp File</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a directory full of files which is maintained with a
set of automated tools; perhaps one set of tools updates them and
another set of tools uses the result.  In this situation, it might be
useful for the second set of tools to know if the files have recently
been changed.  It might be useful, for example, to have a &rsquo;timestamp&rsquo;
file which gives the timestamp on the newest file in the collection.
</p>
<p>We can use <code class="code">find</code> to achieve this, but there are several
different ways to do it.

<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Updating-the-Timestamp-The-Wrong-Way">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.1 Updating the Timestamp The Wrong Way</h4>

<p>The obvious but wrong answer is just to use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-newer</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find subdir -newer timestamp -exec touch -r {} timestamp \;
</pre></div>

<p>This does the right sort of thing but has a bug.  Suppose that two
files in the subdirectory have been updated, and that these are called
<samp class="file">file1</samp> and <samp class="file">file2</samp>.  The command above will update
<samp class="file">timestamp</samp> with the modification time of <samp class="file">file1</samp> or that of
<samp class="file">file2</samp>, but we don&rsquo;t know which one.  Since the timestamps on
<samp class="file">file1</samp> and <samp class="file">file2</samp> will in general be different, this could
well be the wrong value.
</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to modify <code class="code">find</code> to recheck the
modification time of <samp class="file">timestamp</samp> every time a file is to be
compared against it, but that will reduce the performance of
<code class="code">find</code>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Using-the-test-utility-to-compare-timestamps">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.2 Using the test utility to compare timestamps</h4>

<p>The <code class="code">test</code> command can be used to compare timestamps:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find subdir -exec test {} -nt timestamp \; -exec touch -r {} timestamp \;
</pre></div>

<p>This will ensure that any changes made to the modification time of
<samp class="file">timestamp</samp> that take place during the execution of <code class="code">find</code>
are taken into account.  This resolves our earlier problem, but
unfortunately this runs much more slowly.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="A-combined-approach">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.3 A combined approach</h4>

<p>We can of course still use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-newer</samp>&rsquo; to cut down on the number of
calls to <code class="code">test</code>:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find subdir -newer timestamp -and \
     -exec test {} -nt timestamp \; -and \
     -exec touch -r {} timestamp \;
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-newer</samp>&rsquo; test excludes all the files which are
definitely older than the timestamp, but all the files which are newer
than the old value of the timestamp are compared against the current
updated timestamp.
</p>
<p>This is indeed faster in general, but the speed difference will depend
on how many updated files there are.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Using-_002dprintf-and-sort-to-compare-timestamps">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.4 Using <code class="code">-printf</code> and <code class="code">sort</code> to compare timestamps</h4>

<p>It is possible to use the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-printf</samp>&rsquo; action to abandon the use of
<code class="code">test</code> entirely:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">newest=$(find subdir -newer timestamp -printf &quot;%A@:%p\n&quot; |
           sort -n |
           tail -n1 |
           cut -d: -f2- )
touch -r &quot;${newest:-timestamp}&quot; timestamp
</pre></div>

<p>The command above works by generating a list of the timestamps and
names of all the files which are newer than the timestamp.  The
<code class="code">sort</code>, <code class="code">tail</code> and <code class="code">cut</code> commands simply pull out the
name of the file with the largest timestamp value (that is, the latest
file).  The <code class="code">touch</code> command is then used to update the timestamp,
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">&quot;${newest:-timestamp}&quot;</code> expression simply expands to the
value of <code class="code">$newest</code> if that variable is set, but to
<samp class="file">timestamp</samp> otherwise.  This ensures that an argument is always
given to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-r</samp>&rsquo; option of the <code class="code">touch</code> command.
</p>
<p>This approach seems quite efficient, but unfortunately it has a
problem.  Many operating systems now keep file modification time
information at a granularity which is finer than one second.
Findutils version 4.3.3 and later will print a fractional part with
%A@, but older versions will not.
</p>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Solving-the-problem-with-make">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.5 Solving the problem with <code class="code">make</code></h4>

<p>Another tool which often works with timestamps is <code class="code">make</code>.  We can
use <code class="code">find</code> to generate a <samp class="file">Makefile</samp> file on the fly and then
use <code class="code">make</code> to update the timestamps:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">makefile=$(mktemp)
find subdir \
        \( \! -xtype l \) \
        -newer timestamp \
        -printf &quot;timestamp:: %p\n\ttouch -r %p timestamp\n\n&quot; &gt; &quot;$makefile&quot;
make -f &quot;$makefile&quot;
rm   -f &quot;$makefile&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately although the solution above is quite elegant, it fails
to cope with white space within file names, and adjusting it to do so
would require a rather complex shell script.
</p>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Coping-with-odd-filenames-too">
<h4 class="subsection">10.3.6 Coping with odd filenames too</h4>

<p>We can fix both of these problems (looping and problems with white
space), and do things more efficiently too.  The following command
works with newlines and doesn&rsquo;t need to sort the list of filenames.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">find subdir -newer timestamp -printf &quot;%A@:%p\0&quot; |
   perl -0 newest.pl |
   xargs --no-run-if-empty --null --replace \
      find {} -maxdepth 0 -newer timestamp -exec touch -r {} timestamp \;
</pre></div>

<p>The first <code class="code">find</code> command generates a list of files which are
newer than the original timestamp file, and prints a list of them with
their timestamps.  The <samp class="file">newest.pl</samp> script simply filters out all
the filenames which have timestamps which are older than whatever the
newest file is:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="verbatim">#! /usr/bin/perl -0
my @newest = ();
my $latest_stamp = undef;
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    my ($stamp, $name) = split(/:/);
    if (!defined($latest_stamp) || ($tstamp &gt; $latest_stamp)) {
        $latest_stamp = $stamp;
        @newest = ();
    }
    if ($tstamp &gt;= $latest_stamp) {
        push @newest, $name;
    }
}
print join(&quot;\0&quot;, @newest);
</pre></div>

<p>This prints a list of zero or more files, all of which are newer than
the original timestamp file, and which have the same timestamp as each
other, to the nearest second.  The second <code class="code">find</code> command takes
each resulting file one at a time, and if that is newer than the
timestamp file, the timestamp is updated.
