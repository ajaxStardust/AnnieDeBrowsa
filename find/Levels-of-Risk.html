<h3 class="section" id="Levels-of-Risk-1">11.1 Levels of Risk</h3>

<p>There are some security risks inherent in the use of <code class="code">find</code>,
<code class="code">xargs</code> and (to a lesser extent) <code class="code">locate</code>.  The severity of
these risks depends on what sort of system you are using:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><strong class="strong">High risk</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Multi-user systems where you do not control (or trust) the other
users, and on which you execute <code class="code">find</code>, including areas where
those other users can manipulate the filesystem (for example beneath
<samp class="file">/home</samp> or <samp class="file">/tmp</samp>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong class="strong">Medium Risk</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Systems where the actions of other users can create file names chosen
by them, but to which they don&rsquo;t have access while <code class="code">find</code> is
being run.  This access might include leaving programs running (shell
background jobs, <code class="code">at</code> or <code class="code">cron</code> tasks, for example).  On
these sorts of systems, carefully written commands (avoiding use of
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-print</samp>&rsquo; for example) should not expose you to a high degree of
risk.  Most systems fall into this category.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong class="strong">Low Risk</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Systems to which untrusted parties do not have access, cannot create
file names of their own choice (even remotely) and which contain no
security flaws which might enable an untrusted third party to gain
access.  Most systems do not fall into this category because there are
many ways in which external parties can affect the names of files that
are created on your system.  The system on which I am writing this for
example automatically downloads software updates from the Internet;
the names of the files in which these updates exist are chosen by
third parties<a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In the discussion above, &ldquo;risk&rdquo; denotes the likelihood that someone
can cause <code class="code">find</code>, <code class="code">xargs</code>, <code class="code">locate</code> or some other
program which is controlled by them to do something you did not
intend.  The levels of risk suggested do not take any account of the
consequences of this sort of event.  That is, if you operate a &ldquo;low
risk&rdquo; type system, but the consequences of a security problem are
disastrous, then you should still give serious thought to all the
possible security problems, many of which of course will not be
discussed here &ndash; this section of the manual is intended to be
informative but not comprehensive or exhaustive.
</p>
<p>If you are responsible for the operation of a system where the
consequences of a security problem could be very important, you should
do two things:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Define a security policy which defines who is allowed to do what
on your system.
</li><li> Seek competent advice on how to enforce your policy, detect
breaches of that policy, and take account of any potential problems
that might fall outside the scope of your policy.
</li></ol>

<p>Of course, I trust these parties to a large
extent anyway, because I install software provided by them; I choose
to trust them in this way, and that&rsquo;s a deliberate choice</p>
