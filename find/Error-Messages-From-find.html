<h3 class="section" id="Error-Messages-From-find-1">12.1 Error Messages From <code class="code">find</code></h3>

<p>Most error messages produced by find are self-explanatory.  Error
messages sometimes include a filename.  When this happens, the
filename is quoted in order to prevent any unusual characters in the
filename making unwanted changes in the state of the terminal.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">invalid predicate `-foo'</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This means that the <code class="code">find</code> command line included something that
started with a dash or other special character.  The <code class="code">find</code>
program tried to interpret this as a test, action or option, but
didn&rsquo;t recognise it.  If it was intended to be a test, check what was
specified against the documentation.  If, on the other hand, the
string is the name of a file which has been expanded from a wildcard
(for example because you have a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; on the command line),
consider using &lsquo;<samp class="samp">./*</samp>&rsquo; or just &lsquo;<samp class="samp">.</samp>&rsquo; instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">unexpected extra predicate</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This usually happens if you have an extra bracket on the command line
(for example &lsquo;<samp class="samp">find . -print \)</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Warning: filesystem /path/foo has recently been mounted</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Warning: filesystem /path/foo has recently been unmounted</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>These messages might appear when <code class="code">find</code> moves into a directory
and finds that the device number and inode are different from what it
expected them to be.  If the directory <code class="code">find</code> has moved into is
on a network filesystem (NFS), it will not issue this message, because
<code class="code">automount</code> frequently mounts new filesystems on directories as
you move into them (that is how it knows you want to use the
filesystem).  So, if you do see this message, be wary &ndash;
<code class="code">automount</code> may not have been responsible.  Consider the
possibility that someone else is manipulating the filesystem while
<code class="code">find</code> is running.  Some people might do this in order to mislead
<code class="code">find</code> or persuade it to look at one set of files when it thought
it was looking at another set.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/path/foo changed during execution of find (old device number 12345, new device number 6789, filesystem type is &lt;whatever&gt;) [ref XXX]</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This message is issued when <code class="code">find</code> moves into a directory and ends up
somewhere it didn&rsquo;t expect to be.  This happens in one of two
circumstances.  Firstly, this happens when <code class="code">automount</code> intervenes
on a system where <code class="code">find</code> doesn&rsquo;t know how to determine what
the current set of mounted filesystems is.
</p>
<p>Secondly, this can happen when the device number of a directory
appears to change during a change of current directory, but
<code class="code">find</code> is moving up the filesystem hierarchy rather than down into it.
In order to prevent <code class="code">find</code> wandering off into some unexpected
part of the filesystem, we stop it at this point.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Don't know how to use getmntent() to read `/etc/mtab'.  This is a bug.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This message is issued when a problem similar to the above occurs on a
system where <code class="code">find</code> doesn&rsquo;t know how to figure out the current
list of mount points.  Ask for help on <a class="email" href="mailto:bug-findutils@gnu.org">bug-findutils@gnu.org</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/path/foo/bar changed during execution of find (old inode number 12345, new inode number 67893, filesystem type is &lt;whatever&gt;) [ref XXX]&quot;),</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This message is issued when <code class="code">find</code> moves into a directory and
discovers that the inode number of that directory
is different from the inode number that it obtained when it examined the
directory previously.  This usually means that while
<code class="code">find</code> was deep in a directory hierarchy doing a
time consuming operation, somebody has moved one of the parent directories to
another location in the same filesystem.  This may or may not have been done
maliciously.  In any case, <code class="code">find</code> stops at this point
to avoid traversing parts of the filesystem that it wasn&rsquo;t
intended to.  You can use <code class="code">ls -li</code> or <code class="code">find /path -inum
12345 -o -inum 67893</code> to find out more about what has happened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">sanity check of the fnmatch() library function failed.</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Please submit a bug report.  You may well be asked questions about
your system, and if you compiled the <code class="code">findutils</code> code yourself,
you should keep your copy of the build tree around.  The likely
explanation is that your system has a buggy implementation of
<code class="code">fnmatch</code> that looks enough like the GNU version to fool
<code class="code">configure</code>, but which doesn&rsquo;t work properly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">cannot fork</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This normally happens if you use the <code class="code">-exec</code> action or
something similar (<code class="code">-ok</code> and so forth) but the system has run out
of free process slots.  This is either because the system is very busy
and the system has reached its maximum process limit, or because you
have a resource limit in place and you&rsquo;ve reached it.  Check the
system for runaway processes (with <code class="code">ps</code>, if possible).  Some process
slots are normally reserved for use by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">root</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">some-program terminated by signal 99</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Some program which was launched with <code class="code">-exec</code> or similar was killed
with a fatal signal.  This is just an advisory message.
</p></dd>
