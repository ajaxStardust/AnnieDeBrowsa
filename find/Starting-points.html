<h3 class="section" id="Starting-points-1">2.2 Starting points</h3>

<p>GNU <code class="code">find</code> searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point
by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the
rules of operator precedence, until the outcome is known (the left hand side
is false for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">and</samp>&rsquo; operations, true for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">or</samp>&rsquo;), at which point
<code class="code">find</code> moves on to the next file name.
</p>
<p>If no starting-point is specified, the current directory &lsquo;<samp class="samp">.</samp>&rsquo; is assumed.
</p>
<p>A double dash &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--</samp>&rsquo; could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining
arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way
<code class="code">find</code> determines the end of the list of starting point arguments:
it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts
with a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo;).
Now, if a starting point argument would begin with a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo;, then <code class="code">find</code>
would treat it as expression argument instead.
Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, and especially to
prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly
treated as expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards
or dubious path names with either &lsquo;<samp class="samp">./</samp>&rsquo;, or to use absolute path names
starting with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable to use the GNU option
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-files0-from</samp>&rsquo; to pass arbitrary starting points to <code class="code">find</code>.
</p>
<dl class="first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn" id="index-_002dfiles0_002dfrom"><span class="category-def">Option: </span><span><strong class="def-name">-files0-from</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">file</var><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-_002dfiles0_002dfrom'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Read the starting points from <samp class="file">file</samp> instead of getting them on the
command line.
In contrast to the known limitations of passing starting points via arguments
on the command line, namely the limitation of the amount of file names,
and the inherent ambiguity of file names clashing with option names,
using this option allows to safely pass an arbitrary number of starting points
to <code class="code">find</code>.
</p>
<p>Using this option and passing starting points on the command line is mutually
exclusive, and is therefore not allowed at the same time.
</p>
<p>The <samp class="file">file</samp> argument is mandatory.
One can use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-files0-from -</samp>&rsquo; to read the list of starting points from the
standard input stream, and e.g. from a pipe.
In this case, the actions &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-ok</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-okdir</samp>&rsquo; are not allowed,
because they would obviously interfere with reading from standard input
in order to get a user confirmation.
</p>
<p>The starting points in <samp class="file">file</samp> have to be separated by ASCII NUL characters.
Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a starting point with a Zero-length
file name is not allowed and will lead to an error diagnostic followed by
a non-Zero exit code later.
</p>
<p>In the case the given <samp class="file">file</samp> is empty, <code class="code">find</code> does not process any
starting point and therefore will exit immediately after parsing the program
arguments.
This is unlike the standard invocation where <code class="code">find</code> assumes the current
directory as starting point if no path argument is passed.
</p>
<p>The processing of the starting points is otherwise as usual, e.g. <code class="code">find</code>
will recurse into subdirectories unless otherwise prevented.
To process only the starting points, one can additionally pass &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-maxdepth 0</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Further notes:
if a file is listed more than once in the input file, it is unspecified
whether it is visited more than once.
If the <samp class="file">file</samp> is mutated during the operation of <code class="code">find</code>, the result
is unspecified as well.
Finally, the seek position within the named &lsquo;<samp class="samp">file</samp>&rsquo; at the time <code class="code">find</code>
exits, be it with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-quit</samp>&rsquo; or in any other way, is also unspecified.
By &quot;unspecified&quot; here is meant that it may or may not work or do any specific
thing, and that the behavior may change from platform to platform, or from
findutils release to release.
</p>
<p>Example:
Given that another program <code class="code">proggy</code> pre-filters and creates a huge
NUL-separated list of files, process those as starting points, and find
all regular, empty files among them:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ proggy | find -files0-from - -maxdepth 0 -type f -empty
</pre></div>
<p>The use of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-files0-from -</samp>&rsquo; means to read the names of the starting points
from standard input, i.e., from the pipe; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-maxdepth 0</samp>&rsquo; ensures that
only explicitly those entries are examined without recursing into directories
(in the case one of the starting points is one).
