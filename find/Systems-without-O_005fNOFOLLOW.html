<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Systems-without-O_005fNOFOLLOW-1">11.2.2.2 Systems without <code class="code">O_NOFOLLOW</code></h4>

<p>The strategy for preventing this type of problem on systems that lack
support for the <code class="code">O_NOFOLLOW</code> flag is more complex.  Each time
<code class="code">find</code> changes directory, it examines the directory it is about
to move to, issues the <code class="code">chdir()</code> system call, and then checks
that it has ended up in the subdirectory it expected.  If all is as
expected, processing continues as normal.  However, there are two main
reasons why the directory might change: the use of an automounter and
someone removing the old directory and replacing it with something
else while <code class="code">find</code> is trying to descend into it.
</p>
<p>Where a filesystem &ldquo;automounter&rdquo; is in use it can be the case that
the use of the <code class="code">chdir()</code> system call can itself cause a new
filesystem to be mounted at that point.  On systems that do not
support <code class="code">O_NOFOLLOW</code>, this will cause <code class="code">find</code>&rsquo;s security check to
fail.
</p>
<p>However, this does not normally represent a security problem, since
the automounter configuration is normally set up by the system
administrator.  Therefore, if the <code class="code">chdir()</code> sanity check fails,
<code class="code">find</code> will make one more attempt<a class="footnote" id="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  If that succeeds, execution
carries on as normal.  This is the usual case for automounters.
</p>
<p>Where an attacker is trying to exploit a race condition, the problem
may not have gone away on the second attempt.  If this is the case,
<code class="code">find</code> will issue a warning message and then ignore that
subdirectory.  When this happens, actions such as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-exec</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-print</samp>&rsquo; may already have taken place for the problematic
subdirectory.  This is because <code class="code">find</code> applies tests and actions
to directories before searching within them (unless &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-depth</samp>&rsquo; was
specified).
</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the directory-change operation and security
check, in the worst case the only things that <code class="code">find</code> would have
done with the directory are to move into it and back out to the
original parent.  No operations would have been performed within that
directory.
