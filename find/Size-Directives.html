<dd><p>The amount of disk space used for this file in 1K blocks. Since disk
space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this is
usually greater than %s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file
is a sparse file (that is, it has &ldquo;holes&rdquo;).

<dd><p>The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks. Since
disk space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this

<dd><p>File&rsquo;s sparseness.  This is calculated as <code class="code">(BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks /
st_size)</code>.  The exact value you will get for an ordinary file of a
certain length is system-dependent.  However, normally sparse files
will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks
and have few holes may have a value which is greater than 1.0.  The
value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually 512
bytes.  If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.  On
systems which lack support for st_blocks, a file&rsquo;s sparseness is
assumed to be 1.0.
